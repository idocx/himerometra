I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Chemistry at <a href=\"https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/\">Hongyi Honor School</a>, Wuhan University, China during 2017~2021.</p>\n<p>I used to be a research intern in <a href=\"https://ceder.berkeley.edu\">Ceder group</a> at UC Berkeley on text-mining synthesis as well as on <a href=\"https://covidscholar.org\">COVIDScholar</a> website. After that, I interned at Machine Learning group, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/\">Microsoft Research Asia</a> on AI for Sustainability.</p>\n<h2>Research Interest</h2>\n<p>My research interest mainly focuses on <strong>self-driving laboratory</strong>, that is, teaching computers and robots to think and behave like a scientist to do experiments, analyse the experimental data, and make decisions. ðŸ¤–</p>\n<p>During my PhD study, I have been working on building a fully automated laboratory for solid-state synthesis (<strong>A-Lab</strong>) located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Here is a <a href=\"https://go.lbl.gov/a-lab\">press article about our A-lab</a> from LBNL.</p>\n<p>Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research. ðŸ˜‰</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/","hasSider":true,"title":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/"}},
