## About Me
I am a 4<sup>th</sup> year Ph.D. student in [Ceder group](https://ceder.berkeley.edu) at [Department of Material Science and Engineering](https://mse.berkeley.edu/), UC Berkeley. I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Chemistry at [Hongyi Honor School](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University, China during 2017~2021.

I used to be a research intern in [Ceder group](https://ceder.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley on text-mining synthesis as well as on [COVIDScholar](https://covidscholar.org) website. After that, I interned at Machine Learning group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) on AI for Sustainability.

## Research Interest
My research interest mainly focuses on **self-driving laboratory**, that is, teaching computers and robots to think and behave like a scientist to do experiments, analyse the experimental data, and make decisions. :robot:

During my PhD study, I have been working on building a fully automated laboratory for solid-state synthesis (**A-Lab**) located at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Here is a [press article about our A-lab](https://go.lbl.gov/a-lab) from LBNL. 

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research. :wink:
