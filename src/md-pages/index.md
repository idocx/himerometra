## About Me
Currently, I am a 1<sup>st</sup> year Ph.D. student in [Department of Material Science and Engineering](https://mse.berkeley.edu/), UC Berkeley. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry at [Hongyi Honor School](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/), Wuhan University, China from 2017 to 2021.

Previously, I was a research intern in [Ceder group](https://ceder.berkeley.edu) at UC Berkeley on text-mining synthesis as well as on [COVIDScholar](https://covidscholar.org) website. After that, I interned at Machine Learning group, [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/) on AI for Sustainability.

For more details, please refer to [my résumé](/yuxing_cv.pdf).

## Research Interest
My research interest mainly focuses on **material informatics** and **automatic synthesis**, that is, teaching computers and robots to think and behave like a scientist.
